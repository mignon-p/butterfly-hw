This repository contains the [KiCad][5] and [Gerber][6] files for a
PCB nightlight shaped like a butterfly.

![photo of nightlight](doc/Butterfly-lights.jpg)

The nightlight contains 18 "NeoPixel" (WS-2812) LEDs, controlled by an
ATtiny85 microcontroller.  (The firmware for the microcontroller is in
[a separate repository][7].)

There is a tiny potentiometer on the back, which can be used to
control the brightness.  (This functionality is handled in software,
so it could potentially be repurposed, such as to control speed or
color instead.)

The nightlight [plugs into a standard USB power adapter][10] (phone
charger), which handles the AC-to-DC conversion.

If you don't want to build your own, I am now
[selling fully assembled butterflies][11].

## Circuit board

Most fabs should work fine, but I chose [JLCPCB][1].  I chose blue
soldermask for my first set of boards, but red or yellow might work,
as well.  I chose the [ENIG][2] finish.

If you're not making any changes to the board, all you need to do is
zip up the files in the `gerber` directory, and upload the zipfile to
JLCPCB.

Note that in the KiCad files and Gerber files, the "front" of the
board is actually the back, and vice-versa. This is because JLCPCB
adds a customer ID number to the front of the board, but I wanted the
number to be on the actual back of the board, where it doesn't disrupt
the esthetics of the nightlight.  (It turns out it's
[possible to specify the location of the customer ID][9], but I hadn't
read that when I first came up with this trick.)

## Assembly

1. Solder the surface-mount components C1, C2, R1, and POT1 onto the
back of the board.

2. Solder the USB plug onto the back of the board.  The plug is meant
to be used at a right angle, so some surgery is required.  Use
needle-nose pliers to bend the pins so that they are straight, rather
than at a right angle.  Insert the pins through the holes in the
board.  Use Scotch tape to hold the plug in place.  Trim the pins just
a little bit, so they don't protrude quite so far through the board.
Solder the pins to the board.  Remove the Scotch tape from the back.
Then, create a bead of solder all the way around where the plug
touches the board on the back, to hold it in place firmly.

3. Solder the 8-pin DIP socket to the front of the board.  The
"U"-shaped indentation should point toward the top of the butterfly.

4. Solder the 18 LEDs to the front of the board.  The LED should be
positioned so that the square pad gets one of the longer legs, not one
of the shorter ones.

5. Create the butterfly's antennae by inserting a length of bare wire
into the holes on the butterfly's head.  (These two holes are
represented by J3 on the schematic.)  It's a tight fit, so friction
may be enough to hold the wire in place, but you can always solder it
to be sure.

6. Program [the firmware][7] into the ATtiny85 chip.

7. Insert the ATtiny85 into the socket on the butterfly.  The dot on
the chip should be in the upper-left corner.

8. Plug the butterfly into the USB power adapter.

9. Plug the power adapter into the wall.

## Bonus Button

SW1 can optionally be populated with a surface-mount pushbutton, which
is connected to physical pin 5 of the ATtiny85.  (Arduino digital pin
0.)  This is not used in the default firmware, and I don't normally
populate it.  But, you can populate it if you want to have an
additional input in custom firmware that you write.  The pushbutton
pulls the pin to GND, so you'll need to activate the internal pullup.
